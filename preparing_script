CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW unitRecordBetweenDate as SELECT count(*) as number, SUM(u."price") as total_price , u."categoryId" FROM "unit" as u WHERE u."status" = 1 GROUP BY u."categoryId" 
 SELECT count(*) as number, SUM(u."price") as total_price , u."categoryId" FROM "unit" as u WHERE u."status" = 1 GROUP BY u."categoryId"
 
select * from unitRecordBetweenDate where '2020-03-23','2020-03-23')

SELECT count(*) as number, SUM(u."price") as total_price , u."categoryId" FROM "unit" as u WHERE u."created" BETWEEN '2020-03-23' AND '2020-03-29' GROUP BY u."categoryId"
